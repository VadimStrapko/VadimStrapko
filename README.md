💫 About Me:

I am a second-year Software Engineering student. I learn Java and work with relational databases (like MySQL). I also practice writing unit tests (JUnit). I like building web applications and APIs. I have experience from university projects and my own small coding projects. I want to improve my skills in programming and software development.
